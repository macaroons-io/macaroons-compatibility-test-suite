macaroons-compatibility-test-suite
==================================

There is a growing number of projects out there, which implement Macaroons.
Macaroons are flexible authorization credentials that support decentralized delegation, attenuation, and verification.
A few projects are listed on http://macaroons.io/

This project aims to establish a test suite, which makes different implementations comparable.
Thus its possible to see, if different implementations with different versions are interoperable.
